# Django Channels Async Websocket Chat

A (very crude) implementation of Django Channels and real time websockets to build an async chat application. This will be rebuilt in the future using production-ready code and implementing ES6+ and React and deployed into the cloud. 

Boilerplate forked from CFE and this [YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVH05S1qab8).
